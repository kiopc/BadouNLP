# Triplet Loss
## Basic Concept
Triplet Loss is a loss function used to train deep learning models, typically for metric learning.

It works by constructing triplets (Anchor, Positive, Negative):

 - Anchor: A reference sample.

 - Positive: A sample similar to the Anchor.

 - Negative: A sample dissimilar to the Anchor.

The training objective is to minimize the distance between the Anchor and Positive while maximizing the distance between the Anchor and Negative in the vector space.

## Application in Text Matching
In text matching, Triplet Loss is often used with deep learning models (e.g., BERT, Siamese Networks).

The model maps text pairs into a vector space, and Triplet Loss optimizes the vector representations so that similar texts are closer, and dissimilar texts are farther apart.

The challenge is to use Triple Loss to effectively do the text matching.
